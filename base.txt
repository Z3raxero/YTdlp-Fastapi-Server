App Outline: Video Audio Extractor
Overview
This application consists of a FastAPI server and a browser extension that work together to extract audio from videos. I'll address your storage concern and provide a comprehensive outline for both components.

FastAPI Server
Core Components
Video Upload Endpoint: Receive videos from the extension
Audio Extraction Service: Process videos to extract audio
Storage/Transmission System: Handle extracted audio files
Job Management: Track extraction progress (for async processing)

POST /api/v1/extract-audio
- Accepts video file
- Returns extracted audio or job ID

GET /api/v1/status/{job_id}
- Check extraction status
- Returns progress percentage

GET /api/v1/download/{job_id}
- Download extracted audio
- Returns audio file with proper headers

Storage Approach Recommendation
Regarding your question about text file hosting vs. per-video submission, I recommend a hybrid approach:

For Small Videos (< 50MB)
Direct processing: Extract and return audio immediately
No server storage: Audio is streamed directly to the user
Benefits: Simpler, no storage costs, better privacy
For Large Videos (≥ 50MB)
Asynchronous processing:
Store video temporarily
Process in background
Notify user when complete
Provide download link
Temporary storage: Auto-delete after 24 hours
Benefits: Better UX for large files, prevents timeouts
Implementation Workflow
User visits a page with a video
Extension detects video and adds context menu option
User right-clicks and selects "Extract Audio"
Extension captures video and sends to server
Server determines size and processing method
Server extracts audio using ffmpeg or moviepy
Server either:
Returns audio directly (small files)
Returns job ID and processes asynchronously (large files)
Extension receives audio or polls for completion
User downloads extracted audio
Tech Stack
Server
FastAPI
Python
ffmpeg (for audio extraction)
Redis (for job queue if needed)
SQLAlchemy (if implementing persistent storage)
Extension
HTML/CSS/JavaScript
Browser APIs (Chrome/Firefox)
Fetch API for server communication
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this outline?
